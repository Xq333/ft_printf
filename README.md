# ft_printf Project README

## Overview

The **ft_printf** project is a pivotal achievement in my 42 school journey. This project challenges students to create their own version of the C standard library's 'printf' function, a fundamental tool for formatted output.

## What I Learned

While working on the **ft_printf** project, I gained a wealth of knowledge and skills, including:

1. **String Manipulation**: I honed my string manipulation skills, learning how to process and format text effectively.

2. **Parsing and Formatting**: I mastered the art of parsing format specifiers, interpreting them, and applying the appropriate formatting to the output.

3. **Variadic Arguments**: This project introduced me to variadic arguments, allowing me to handle and process a variable number of arguments.

4. **Code Structure**: I learned to organize and structure code efficiently to handle complex and diverse format specifiers.

## Project Structure

The **ft_printf** project typically involves creating a custom 'printf' function capable of handling various format specifiers (e.g., %s for strings, %d for integers) and performing precise formatting and output to the console.

## Usage

The skills I acquired through the **ft_printf** project are applicable to a wide range of programming tasks requiring formatted text output. It's a valuable tool for improving code readability and user interaction in various applications.

## Credits

This project was completed as part of my 42 school curriculum.
